## open by design

opencare deliverables - all being labeled with a public dissemination level - are disclosed on our website to the attention to the [European / world] citizens.

By doing so, we are fully compliant with the terms determined by our funding agreement (*Article 29.1 Obligation to disseminate results, Horizon 2020 Grant Agreement model*), and above all, with the spirit, which initiated and animated the opencare project.

These deliverables have been ideated and designed by the opencare consortium to allow people, communities and policy-makers to get inspired, fork, enhance or tailor to their very specific needs the research results we produced over these two years.
